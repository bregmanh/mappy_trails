# Mappy Trails LHL Midterm Project
--from the brains of Hannah Bregman, Bryan Gomes, and Charlie Hayes, in conjunction with Lighthouse Labs--

Travelling, especially in a city, can be a joyless affair. You have an appointment, and you arrive early, so stand beneath the eaves as the snow pours down, checking your watch until it's socially acceptable for you to enter. 

Or your friends are visiting town, and they're waiting for you to get off work. Your boss shoos them from the premises--where will they go, what will they do? 

Or you're revisiting an old haunt, a place you remember being before--where was that bar? Was it around this corner, or the next one? 

Enter Mappy Trails. Modeled after the treasure maps of old and leveraging the full power of Google Maps' API, our full-featured, multi-page app allows users to create personalized maps with personalized points in four categories: drinks, foods, cafes, and arts. Not feeling too creative today? You can still favorite maps from other users to save them for later, or use them to inspire your own new trail through your hometown or current haunt. 

Mappy Trails: because no trip should be unremarkable.
